# YouTube Download Splitter (by George Tsakalos)

## Features

- **Chapters-aware**: Detects YouTube chapters (timeline markers) and splits into separate files.
- **Video or Audio**: Choose to download the full video (muxed) or audio-only.
- **Format control**:
  - Video containers: `mp4`, `mkv`, `webm`
  - Audio formats: `mp3`, `m4a`, `flac`, `wav`, `opus`
- **Resolution cap** (video): pick *best*, 2160p, 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, or 360p.
- **Audio bitrate** (audio-only): pick 128â€“320 kbps.
- **Clean filenames** with chapter numbers and titles.

> If a video has **no chapters**, the tool downloads a single file.
